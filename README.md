# Iron News 

See this app here: https://tiy-iron-news.herokuapp.com/ 

## This app is built with Rails 5.0 and Ruby 2.4

* Using Hacker News as inspiration, I built this app to utilize database features of Ruby and Rails.
* This app brings together everything I have learned so far, including:
  * Bootstrap
  * Forms
  * ActiveRecord and databases for storing data
  * Classes, blocks, and enumerables
  * ERB
* Authentication via bcrypt
